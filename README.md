# Explain My Mistake

**Explain My Mistake** is a human-centered AI tutor powered by **Gemini 3** that helps learners understand *why* their answers are wrong and guides them toward conceptual clarity instead of simply giving correct answers.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Many learners struggle not because they lack effort, but because they don’t understand **why** their answer is incorrect.  
Most AI tools focus on delivering the right answer, leaving misconceptions unresolved.

**Explain My Mistake** addresses this gap by diagnosing misunderstandings and adapting how it teaches each learner.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Misconception Diagnosis**  
  Identifies the root cause behind incorrect reasoning, not just wrong answers.

- **Adaptive Teaching**  
  Dynamically adjusts explanations and follow-up questions based on learner understanding.

- **Practice with Feedback**  
  Generates targeted practice questions and evaluates learner responses with scoring and feedback.

- **Kids Mode (Age ≤ 12)**  
  - Requires parental consent  
  - Uses simple language and encouragement  
  - Provides easy True/False concept checks

- **Automatic Domain Detection**  
  Detects whether the problem relates to math, science, coding, writing, or general learning—without defaulting to coding.

- **Accessibility & Audio Support**  
  Supports voice-based interaction for audio-first and visually impaired learners.

- **Learning Snapshot**  
  Summarizes progress, key mistakes, and readiness at the end of each session.
